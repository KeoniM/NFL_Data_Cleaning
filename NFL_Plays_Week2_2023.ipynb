        "**PURPOSE:**\n",
        "- Accurately clean a week's worth of play data\n",
        "  - Season 2023 -> Week 2\n",
        "\n",
        "**THOUGHTS, CONCERNS AND IDEAS FOR LATER:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*General*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Players with the same name\n",
        "  - I do think that the raw data has naming conventions to decipher between two players with the exact same name but not 100% sure.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Cleaning check (TESTING)\n",
        "  - I need a method that will help decern whether these plays have been cleaned correctly. Currently I am manually checking but this is not sustainable or efficient.\n",
        "    - **IDEA:** Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness. (maybe return a df that highlights differences?)\n",
        "    - **PROBLEM:** There are differences one how different organizations(?) record stats for players. For example, NFL.com and espn.com are not the same on what they consider a solo tackle or an assisted tackle.\n",
        "    - **PROBLEM 2:** NFL.com does not have every play recorded on their website. So far I have found that it is common for a game to miss at least 1 play.\n",
        "      - What do I do about this?\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Adjust features (PlayOutcomes/PlayTypes/IsScoringDrive/etc...) for plays that have been split up into multiple rows (Fumble Recoveries, Interceptions, etc...).\n",
        "  - EXAMPLE: Any fumble recovery that is not the runningback on an intended running play should not count as rushing yards for the player who recovered the fumble.\n",
        "    - IDEA: Should I broaden 'playtypes' to include:\n",
        "      1. yardage after fumble (Currently have it as 'Run' playtype)\n",
        "          - UPDATE: All recoveries after a fumble for yardage is under the umbrella playtype 'Fumble Return'\n",
        "      2. yardage after interception (Currently have it as 'Interception')\n",
        "          - UPDATE: All interceptions for yardage is under the umbrella playtype 'Run After Interception'\n",
        "  - EXAMPLE: If a team throws an interception and that interception results in a touchdown for the opposing team, I do not think it should be considered as a 'scoring drive' for the team that threw the interception.\n",
        "    - IDEA: For the category \"isScoringDrive\" the categories could be:\n",
        "      1. 0 - Is not a scoring drive\n",
        "      2. 1 - Is scoring drive for team on offense\n",
        "      3. 2 - Is scoring drive for team on defense\n",
        "      - ^^^ SHOULD IMPLEMENT ^^^\n",
        "\n",
        "4. I need to add to 'dict_names'. The Rams have 2 different values for accronyms. they have 1. 'LAR' and 2. 'LA'.\n",
        "  - This impacts a bit of code in here becaues now I will have to adjust for dictionaries to have possible list type values.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. I am 1000000% sure that there are many ways to make this code more efficient, clean and easier to read.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Offense*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Trick plays\n",
        "  - Need a larger sample size that contains more trick plays\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Handoffs\n",
        "  - Need a larger sample size that contains more handoffs\n",
        "    - (Only one has been found within the dataset \"Season 2023 Week 1\", it was handled for that specific play type but have not implement for all)\n",
        "      - IDEA: Implement 'Handoff' into cleaning method for run plays. I believe the only time that you would be able to handoff the ball to someone is during a run play.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Defense*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Nuance of players recorded for sacks & forced fumbles\n",
        "  - Look under sack play type cleaning method\n",
        "    - The formatting of multiple defending players in on a fumbled play may cause wrong recording of data (e.i. player who assisted in tackle may be credited for the forced fumble)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. SUBJECTIVE DEFENSIVE STAT RECORDING\n",
        "  - Depending on where you look for your defensive stats, their recordings may be different. For example, a solo tackle for one company recording stats may be an assisted tackle for another. (e.g. 'NFL.com' <-> 'espn.com')\n",
        "    - In my opinion, I think there are times where both of them have errors in their stat tables.\n",
        "      - EXAMPLE:\n",
        "        - \"(7:54) (Shotgun) D.Jones sacked at NYG 15 for -10 yards (M.Parsons)\"\n",
        "          - M.Parsons - awarded 1 sack & 1 TFL\n",
        "        - \"(5:27) (No Huddle, Shotgun) D.Jones sacked at NYG 34 for -8 yards (C.Golston)\"\n",
        "          - C.Golston - awarded 1 sack & 0 TFL\n",
        "        - This is shown in both NFL.com & espn.com\n",
        "  - Another example, an assisted tackle for loss may count as a TFL for that player by one stat crew but another may record that the player just had an assisted tackle.\n",
        "  - I have made tables to try and mimic both 'NFL.com' and 'espn.com' but the dataset is flexable and can be adjusted towards preference.\n",
        "    - ';' means solo and assisted tackle\n",
        "    - ',' means 0.5 tackle\n",
        "      - From what I have seen, the ordering matters when it comes to awarding defensive players a solo tackle vs. an assisted vs. awarding them anything at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Safety\n",
        "  - I have not come across safeties yet."
