        "- Cleaning check\n",
        "  - Figure out some type of method that will help decern whether these plays have been cleaned correctly.\n",
        "    - Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness.\n",
        "- FUMBLE RECOVERIES\n",
        "  - Change the 'PlayType' and 'PlayOutcome' of fumble recoveries\n",
        "  - SITUATION: Running back fumbles on a run play but recovers it and rushes for x yards.\n",

        "  - SITUATION: Any fumble recovery that is not the runningback on an intended running play\n",
        "    - This would not count as rushing yards for the player who recovered the fumble.\n",

        "- Should I broaden 'playtypes' to include:\n",
