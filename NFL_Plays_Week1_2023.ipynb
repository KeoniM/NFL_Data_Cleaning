        "    - Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness.\n",
        "- FUMBLE RECOVERIES\n",
        "  - Change the 'PlayType' and 'PlayOutcome' of fumble recoveries\n",
        "  - SITUATION: Running back fumbles on a run play but recovers it and rushes for x yards.\n",
