        "- Correctly clean a week sample size of plays\n",
        "  - Season 2023 -> Week 1\n",
        "\n",
        "CONCERNS FOR LATER:\n",
        "- Players with the same name\n",
        "  - The current goal is to use the fewest possible indicators or features to distinguish between players with the same name.\n",
        "    - Maybe there is a more simple way?\n",
        "- Trick plays\n",
        "  - latterals  \n",
        "- Cleaning check\n",
        "  - I need to figure out how to create some type of check to make sure that these plays are being cleaned correctly.\n",
        "- Cleaning check\n",
        "  - Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness.\n",
        "  - NOTE:\n",
        "    - I need to figure out what to categorize fumble recoveries as. (example: Do I categorize a fumble recovery as a 'run' playtype and add yardage to total yards gained for that player?\n",
        "- Nuance of players recorded for sacks & forced fumbles\n",
        "  - Look under sack play type cleaning method\n",
        "    - The formatting of multiple defending players in on a fumbled play may cause wrong recording of data (e.i. player who assisted in tackle may be credited for the forced fumble)\n",
        "- Fix playoutcomes and playtypes for plays that have been split up into multiple rows.\n",
        "  - For example, If a team throws an interception and that interception results in a touchdown for the opposing team, I do not think it should be considered as a 'scoring drive' for the team that threw the interception.\n",
        "- Should I broaden 'playtypes' to include:\n",
        "  1. yardage after fumble (Currently have it as 'Run' playtype)\n",
        "  2. yardage after interception (Currently have it as 'Interception')\n",
        "- I will condense features later, for now I will have many.\n",
        "\n",
        "LATER IDEAS:\n",
        "- Universal 'Fumble' helper method for all playtypes. <---\n",
        "  - Extract all data and get rid of category \"FumbleDetails\"\n",
        "- Create a category \"ForceFumbleBy\" <---\n",
        "- Use 'fuzzywuzzy' to group like play outcomes to parse different plays\n",
        "- Map team name with their abbreviations ( e.g. \"Cowboys\" <-> \"DAL\" )\n",
        "  - Maybe with larger datasets with multiple weeks, I can map team names with team abbrevations that match up the most.\n",
        "- For the category \"isScoringDrive\" the categories could be:\n",
        "  1. 0 - Is not a scoring drive\n",
        "  2. 1 - Is scoring drive for team on offense\n",
        "  3. 2 - Is scoring drive for team on defense\n",
        "\n",
        "DEFENSE GOALS:\n",
