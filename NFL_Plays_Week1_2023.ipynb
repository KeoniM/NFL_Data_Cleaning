        "- Accurately clean a week's worth of play data\n",
        "  - Season 2023 -> Week 1\n",
        "\n",
        "**CONCERNS FOR LATER:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*General*\n",
        "\n",
        "- Players with the same name\n",
        "- Cleaning check\n",
        "  - Figure out some type of method that will help decern whether these plays have been cleaned correctly.\n",
        "    - Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness.\n",
        "- FUMBLE RECOVERIES\n",
        "  - Change the 'PlayType' and 'PlayOutcome' of fumble recoveries\n",
        "  - SITUATION: Running back fumbles on a run play but recovers it and rushes for x yards.\n",
        "    - This would still count towards his rushing yards.\n",
        "    - 'PlayType' = 'Run'\n",
        "    - 'PlayOutcome' = 'X Yard Run'\n",
        "      - 2 rows will be present for this type of play. 1 before fumble and 1 after fumble. Each will have their own separate 'PlayOutcome'..?\n",
        "  - SITUATION: Any fumble recovery that is not the runningback on an intended running play\n",
        "    - This would not count as rushing yards for the player who recovered the fumble.\n",
        "    - 'PlayType' = 'Fumble Return'\n",
        "    - 'PlayOutcome' = 'X Yard Fumble Return'\n",
        "- Fix playoutcomes and playtypes for plays that have been split up into multiple rows.\n",
        "  - For example, If a team throws an interception and that interception results in a touchdown for the opposing team, I do not think it should be considered as a 'scoring drive' for the team that threw the interception.\n",
        "- Should I broaden 'playtypes' to include:\n",
        "  1. yardage after fumble (Currently have it as 'Run' playtype)\n",
        "  2. yardage after interception (Currently have it as 'Interception')\n",
        "- Condense features.\n",
        "- Condense regular expressions to grab multiple pieces of wanted data instead of individual.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Offense*\n",
        "\n",
        "- Trick plays\n",
        "- Latterals\n",
        "\n",
        "*Defense*\n",
        "\n",
        "- Nuance of players recorded for sacks & forced fumbles\n",
        "  - Look under sack play type cleaning method\n",
        "    - The formatting of multiple defending players in on a fumbled play may cause wrong recording of data (e.i. player who assisted in tackle may be credited for the forced fumble)\n",
        "\n",
        "- DEFENSIVE STATS ARE CURRENTLY WRONG\n",
        "  - I will work on 0.5 tackes, solo tackles and assists. I need to adjust cleaning methods to collect this data better.\n",
        "    - ';' means solo and assisted tackle\n",
        "    - ',' means 0.5 tackle\n",
        "\n",
        "LATER IDEAS:\n",
        "- Use 'Fuzzywuzzy' to find like play outcomes.\n",
        "  - This will give me a chance to automate play types instead of eying them and seaparating them manually.\n",
        "- Map team name with their abbreviations ( e.g. \"Cowboys\" <-> \"DAL\" )\n",
        "  - Maybe with larger datasets with multiple weeks, I can map team names with team abbrevations that match up the most.\n",
        "- For the category \"isScoringDrive\" the categories could be:\n",
        "  1. 0 - Is not a scoring drive\n",
        "  2. 1 - Is scoring drive for team on offense\n",
        "  3. 2 - Is scoring drive for team on defense\n",
        "- Shorten cleaning methods by creating a helper method to grab data from the defense on a play\n",
        "- **TESTING**\n",
        "  - Make sure every play has been cleaned\n",
        "    - Maybe for this I can have each play that is cleaned have a column that marks whether the play has been cleaned or not? So every play that has been cleaned will have a check next to it.\n",
        "  - Grab NFL stat sheets from games to cross reference and test outcomes\n",
        "- Add new feature for player who recovered fumble\n",
        "- I am going to have to make a new helper method to handle \"Handoff\" plays.\n",
        "  - Should I make a new feature for handoffs? Like a feature that links one action to another? Would that be valuable?\n",
        "- When a play is split up into multiple rows, should each row have the starting formation of the play or should the initial starting row of the play have the formation?\n",
        "- Prep all cleaning methods to be able to handle SLICES of the original dataframe."
