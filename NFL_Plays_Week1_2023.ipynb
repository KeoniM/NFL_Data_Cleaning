        "- Accurately clean a week's worth of play data\n",
        "  - Season 2023 -> Week 1\n",
        "\n",
        "**THOUGHTS, CONCERNS AND IDEAS FOR LATER:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*General*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Players with the same name\n",
        "  - I do think that the raw data has naming conventions to decipher between two players with the exact same name but not 100% sure.\n",
        "2. Cleaning check (TESTING)\n",
        "  - I need some type of method that will help decern whether these plays have been cleaned correctly. Currently I am manually checking but this is not sustainable or efficient.\n",
        "    - **IDEA:** Cross reference recorded NFL stats with stats here and compare likeness. (maybe return a df that highlights differences?)\n",
        "3. Adjust features (PlayOutcomes/PlayTypes/IsScoringDrive/etc...) for plays that have been split up into multiple rows (Fumble Recoveries, Interceptions, etc...).\n",
        "  - EXAMPLE: Running back fumbles on a run play but recovers it and rushes for x yards.\n",
        "    - This would still count towards his rushing yards.\n",
        "    - 'PlayType' = 'Run'\n",
        "    - 'PlayOutcome' = 'X Yard Run'\n",
        "      - 2 rows will be present for this type of play. 1 before fumble and 1 after fumble. Each will have their own separate 'PlayOutcome'..?\n",
        "  - EXAMPLE: Any fumble recovery that is not the runningback on an intended running play\n",
        "    - This would not count as rushing yards for the player who recovered the fumble.\n",
        "    - 'PlayType' = 'Fumble Return'..?\n",
        "    - 'PlayOutcome' = 'X Yard Fumble Return'..?\n",
        "  - EXAMPLE: If a team throws an interception and that interception results in a touchdown for the opposing team, I do not think it should be considered as a 'scoring drive' for the team that threw the interception.\n",
        "    - IDEA: For the category \"isScoringDrive\" the categories could be:\n",
        "      1. 0 - Is not a scoring drive\n",
        "      2. 1 - Is scoring drive for team on offense\n",
        "      3. 2 - Is scoring drive for team on defense\n",
        "  - When a play is split up into multiple rows, should each row have the starting formation of the play or should the initial starting row of the play have the formation?\n",
        "  - IDEA: Should I broaden 'playtypes' to include:\n",
        "    1. yardage after fumble (Currently have it as 'Run' playtype)\n",
        "    2. yardage after interception (Currently have it as 'Interception')\n",
        "4. Condense features.\n",
        "  - For plays such as punt or kickoff, maybe I can group together data such as who is the longsnapper, holder and kicker instead of representing them on their own.\n",
        "5. Condense regular expressions to grab multiple pieces of wanted data instead of individual.\n",
        "6. Use 'Fuzzywuzzy' to find like play outcomes.\n",
        "  - This will give me a chance to automate play types instead of eying them and seaparating them manually.\n",
        "    - Not sure if I will actually need this?\n",
        "7. Map team name with their abbreviations ( e.g. \"Cowboys\" <-> \"DAL\" )\n",
        "  - Maybe with larger datasets with multiple weeks, I can map team names with team abbrevations that match up the most.\n",
        "8. Shorten cleaning methods by creating a helper method to grab data from the defense on a play\n",
        "9. Add features to break down penalty plays.\n",
        "10. Punt and kickoff returns are practically identical. Try to find a regular expression that will capture them both AND catch touchdown plays too.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Offense*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Trick plays\n",
        "  - Need a larger sample size that contains more trick plays\n",
        "2. Latterals\n",
        "  - Need a larger sample size that contains more latterals\n",
        "    - (Only one has been found within the dataset \"Season 2023 Week 1\", it was handled for that specific play type but have not implement for all)\n",
        "      - IDEA: Make a new helper method to handle \"Handoff\" plays.\n",
        "        - Should I make a new feature for handoffs? Like a feature that links one action to another? Would that be valuable?\n",
        "\n",
        "*Defense*\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Nuance of players recorded for sacks & forced fumbles\n",
        "  - Look under sack play type cleaning method\n",
        "    - The formatting of multiple defending players in on a fumbled play may cause wrong recording of data (e.i. player who assisted in tackle may be credited for the forced fumble)\n",
        "\n",
        "2. DEFENSIVE STATS ARE CURRENTLY WRONG\n",
        "  - I will work on 0.5 tackes, solo tackles and assists. I need to adjust cleaning methods to collect this data better.\n",
        "    - ';' means solo and assisted tackle\n",
        "    - ',' means 0.5 tackle\n",
        "  - Need to figure out when players a noticed for good coverage? Assisting in an interception (I think this is what the play descriptions are stating?)"
